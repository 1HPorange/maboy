# MaBoy GameBoy Emulator

MaBoy is a fast and (mostly) accurate GameBoy emulator for Windows, written in Rust. It focuses heavily on performance, but without ever sacrificing emulation accuracy. At the same time, it attempts to minimize power consumption to make sure that you can use it on your laptop.

*This project is a work in progress. Currently, it can only run a limited amount of ROMs due to missing MBC support. Pok√©mon Games are not yet supported because of this.*
